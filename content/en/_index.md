Hello, I’m Erik and I’m a front-end web developer and user experience designer with a varied history of working in many industries. My specialties include user interface design and user experience. As a team lead, I also have experience running a small team of front-end developers, graphic designers and user experience designers in an agile environment. I am currently in a part-time technology bootcamp with MIT xPro learning the MERN technology stack.
