Native iOS development refers to the process of building an application specifically for iOS using the native programming language, which is Swift or Objective-C. Developing natively ensures that the application is optimized for iOS devices and takes full advantage of their hardware and software features. Native development also provides complete control over the application's performance, appearance, and functionality.

On the other hand, using a framework like React Native enables developers to build cross-platform applications using JavaScript. React Native is a popular choice for building iOS applications because it allows developers to create an application for both iOS and Android platforms using the same codebase. React Native utilizes a combination of native components and JavaScript, which provides developers with access to the underlying platform's features.

While using a framework like React Native can be faster and more cost-effective, it may not provide the same level of control and optimization as native development. React Native can be slower than native development because it relies on a bridge to communicate between JavaScript and native components. Additionally, developers may face limitations in terms of access to the underlying platform's features, such as device sensors or platform-specific UI elements.

Native development requires specific knowledge of iOS development, including proficiency in Swift or Objective-C. It can take longer to develop native applications because developers need to write code separately for each platform. However, it provides developers with complete control over the application's functionality, and the application can be optimized specifically for the iOS platform.

In summary, both native iOS development and using a framework like React Native have their advantages and disadvantages. The choice between them depends on the requirements of the project, including the complexity of the application, budget, timeline, and required features. Native development is ideal for complex applications that require complete control over performance, appearance, and functionality. On the other hand, using a framework like React Native is ideal for cross-platform applications that require faster development and cost-effective solutions.
