## Eyes Exercise

In this project I created a "real time train tracker." This project was based on the MIT xPro project where we used MapBox to map and animate all route stops for a bus line from the MIT campus to the Harvard campus.

I adapted the project to run on the Chicago 'L' system on the Red Line Train going in a south direction. This route happens to be the route I use and take to work!

Data is from the city of Chicago data portal. I pulled the longitude and latitude data from data portal and mapped them along.

Since the application requires a MabBox API key to run and I did not want to publish my own, here is a YouTube video of it working.
