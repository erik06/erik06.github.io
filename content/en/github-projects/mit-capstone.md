## MIT xPro Capstone Project - Chicago Chow

I completed a comprehensive Full-Stack Restaurant Application Project, where I developed a robust and efficient application demonstrating key features such as front-end architecture utilizing Next.js, authentication, and integrated Stripe for smooth checkout experience. I incorporated advanced features like user interface updates, conditional rendering of the checkout cart, and detail restaurant pages listing all the dishes.

The website, Chicago Chow, displays a list of restaurants on the homepage, allowing users to select a restaurant and view its dishes, facilitating user-friendly navigation. I integrated search functionality for both restaurants and dishes, ensuring users can seamlessly find their preferred options. Additionally, the cart functionality was refined to allow users to easily add or remove dishes, automatically update prices, and modify quantities, focusing on user-centric design and functionality.

To meticulously present the various components and functionalities of my project, I submitted three detailed presentation videos, each discussing different aspects of the application, including front-end architecture, authentication, Stripe integration, database structure, API endpoints, deployment processes, additional features, and a reflection on the entire project. Each presentation was structured around key points and followed a coherent slide template, elucidating the interaction between the different components of the MERN Stack.

I faced some challenges during the deployment phase, but I effectively overcame them by employing problem-solving skills and technical acumen, ensuring the successful launch of the application. Reflecting on the project, I contemplated on the methodologies and considered what could be done differently if I were to start the project anew, ensuring continuous learning and improvement. The project not only allowed me to create and interact with a database and integrate React with a back-end GraphQL API powered by Strapi but also honed my abilities to build a full-stack web application using the MERN Stack.
